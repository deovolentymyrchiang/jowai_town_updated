                        &quot;At a distance of 4 km from Jowai Bus Stand, Syntu Ksiar is a scenic place
                        located in Jowai town of West Jaintia Hills district in Meghalaya. Situated on the banks of
                        Myntdu River, it is one of the lovely places to visit in Jowai and among the famous historical
                        places in

                        <br><br>
                        Syntu Ksiar is a vast stretch of land that lies on the banks of Myntdu River. The literal
                        meaning of Syntu Ksiar is 'the golden flower' in the local Jaintia language. According to the
                        legend,
                        the place
                        got its name from a lady called Syntu of 'Iawchibidi' clan. It is believed that the lady
                        committed
                        suicide by
                        jumping into the river here. After she drowned in the river, a beautiful golden flower bloomed
                        in the
                        middle of the river which is said to be very beautiful and cannot be plucked by anybody. Thus,
                        the place
                        got
                        its name from this particular flower which grows here.
                        <br><br>
                        Syntu Ksiar is also renowned for being the center of the freedom struggle as this is the place
                        from where freedom fighter Kiang Nangbah had initiated the freedom struggle against the British.
                        He was
                        hanged to death on 30th December 1862 in Jowai town. A memorial has been erected here in memory
                        of Kiang
                        Nangbah.
